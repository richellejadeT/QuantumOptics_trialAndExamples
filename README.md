# Quantum_Julia
Here are my repositories of trials and replication using the QuantumOptics framework. The main goal of this is for me to get a better understanding of how to simulate quantum systems using QuantumOptics.

# Acknowledgement

We acknowledge the QuantumOptics library and documentation which helped us demonstrate and replicate the results to learn more about the framework.
